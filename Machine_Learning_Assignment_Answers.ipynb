    "# Q27. Explain data encoding?\n",
    "# ans = Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand and process. Since most algorithms require numerical input, encoding categorical features is a crucial preprocessing step. Common encoding methods include One-Hot Encoding (creating binary columns for each category) and Label Encoding (assigning a unique integer to each category). The choice of encoding depends on the nature of the categorical variable (nominal or ordinal) and the specific machine learning algorithm being used."
